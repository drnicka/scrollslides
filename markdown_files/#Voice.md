## What is #Voice?

#Voice dApp helps the Scroll community find collective agreement through decentralized discussions and secure governance. It combines AI with identity-based voting to gather community input and highlight shared priorities. The platform turns insights into clear action points and fosters meaningful engagement.

## Why #Voice, Why Now?

#Voice captures and synthesizes individual input into collective intelligence. Itâ€™s a non-financial tool for discussion and decision-making that bridges the gap between crypto and AI. Key benefits include:

- **Easy Access**: Non-technical users can sign up with email, while crypto users have full control over wallets.
- **Fair Participation**: Identity gating builds secure and sybil-resistant contributions.
- **Better Usability**: Intuitive design and clear outputs make it easier to use than existing tools like Polis.

Factory Labs has successfully tested #Voice in London communities, proving its ability to engage diverse groups effectively.

## Features and Improvements Over Existing Tools

- **Simple Onboarding**: Email login creates wallets automatically. We can build in scroll namespace.
- **Clear Outputs**: Results are actionable and easy to understand.
- **Validated Data**: The data created by Voice is informed by theoretical research methodology. The data is rich contextual and multi-modal and ideal AI training data.

## The Factory Protocol

#Voice is powered by the Factory Protocol, a set of tools for building economic and decision-making systems. FactoryDAO served as a precursor to #Voice.

## Delivery Schedule

### Technical Build (Commence ASAP):

1. **Magic Link Alternative**: Research and integrate alternatives on Scroll.
2. **Scroll Name Service**: Integrate or find equivalent solutions.
3. **AI Integration**: Finalize and test.
4. **Smart Contracts**: Build and deploy #Voice factory smart contracts.
5. **Custom Front Ends**: Design and build new interfaces.
6. **Test Deployment**: Deploy on Scroll Sepolia Testnet (21.02.25).
7. **Focus Group Testing**: Conduct testing and collect feedback.
8. **Improvements**: Address bugs and refine.

### Launch:

1. Deploy on Scroll Mainnet (07.03.25).
2. Conduct final testing and improvements.
3. Showcase at Eth Denver (23.03.25).
4. Roll into DAO-funded event series as detailed in the DAO proposal.

### Maintenance:

- Initial maintenance covered by this budget. Future funding requests will focus on server and maintenance costs.

## Ask

Factory Labs seeks support from the Scroll Foundation to finalize #Voice as a public good. With 70% of development complete, we need additional support to:

1. Finish the roadmap.
2. Provide a fully functional, self-serve tool for the Scroll community.
3. Ensure long-term sustainability with minimal ongoing costs.

### Timeline Feasibility

We propose an 8-week development, testing, and deployment window starting the week of 16th December 2024. Despite the tight timeline, we are prepared to work through the holiday period to meet the deadline.
