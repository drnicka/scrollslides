# **#Voice: Aligning Capital for Public Goods with AI and SBV**

---

## **Slide 1: The Problem**
### Public goods funding is broken
- **Visibility dominates**: Popularity contests overshadow critical contributions.
- **Misaligned funding**: Surface-level preferences win over systemic priorities.
- **Correlation bias**: Shared narratives lead to redundant and ineffective funding.

---

## **Slide 2: The Opportunity**
### Funding public goods effectively
- **Systemic value**: Align funding with long-term ecosystem health.
- **Uncover hidden value**: Reward critical but less-visible contributions.
- **Bridge preferences**: Highlight shared priorities across diverse stakeholders.

---

## **Slide 3: Introducing #Voice**
### A Public Good Governance dApp
- Combines **Semantic Ballot Voting (SBV)**, AI, and identity-based quadratic voting.
- Captures **multi-dimensional preferences** and transforms them into actionable insights.
- Powered by Factory Labs, experts in blockchain and AI research.

---

## **Slide 4: How #Voice Works**
1. **Semantic Tags**: Voters allocate preferences across thematic axes (e.g., #DeveloperTools, #UserEducation).
2. **Quadratic Voting**: Costs grow quadratically, forcing prioritization.
3. **Preference Graphs**: Build weighted graphs to identify systemic priorities.
4. **AI Analysis**: Extract themes, sentiment, and relationships from qualitative feedback.

---

## **Slide 5: Why Semantic Ballot Voting?**
### Solving Public Goods Funding Challenges
- **Move beyond popularity**: Focus on systemic importance, not visibility.
- **Diversify preferences**: Reduce correlation through quadratic voting.
- **Surface hidden value**: Identify critical pathways and thematic clusters.
- **Contextual decisions**: Ground votes with qualitative reasoning.

---

## **Slide 6: Real-World Impact**
### Public Goods Funding Example
- **Semantic Tags**: #DeveloperTools, #ProtocolUpgrade, #SecurityAudits.
- **Outcome**: Graph identifies #DeveloperTools as a **bridging priority** connecting security and upgrades.
- **Result**: Funding flows to maximize ecosystem resilience.

---

## **Slide 7: Features of #Voice**
- **Actionable Insights**: Visualize thematic clusters and critical pathways.
- **Sybil Resistance**: Identity gating ensures fairness.
- **Accessible Onboarding**: Email signups and wallet integration.
- **Validated Data**: Rich datasets ideal for AI-driven governance tooling.
