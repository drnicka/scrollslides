# Negation Voice: A DeSci Experiment in Preference Signalling

**Proposal Type:** Community (with relevance to Growth & Governance)

---

## Summary

**Concise Summary:**  
Negation Voice introduces two complementary governance tools—**#VOICE** and **The Negation Game**—to pioneer a scalable, mechanism-oriented approach for preference signaling within the Scroll DAO. Rather than relying solely on extended discussion or simple voting, this experiment employs structured, data-rich protocols to capture both what the community supports (#VOICE) and what it rejects (The Negation Game).

- **#VOICE:** Uses Semantic Ballot Voting, a variant of quadratic voting, to let participants allocate a budget of voting power across semantic tags. This creates a “semantic hypergraph” of preferences that is enriched by natural language data and can reveal complex relationships between community values.

- **The Negation Game:** Inspired by epistemic and economic theory, this protocol focuses on falsification and bargaining. It tests the defensibility of community beliefs by encouraging participants to challenge, refine, or reject propositions. Financial or credibility stakes incentivize intellectual honesty and careful reasoning.

By running both tools in tandem, we gain a multi-dimensional view of community sentiment—what is embraced, what is contested, and where the collective stands after rigorous testing. As the DAO faces multiple governance proposals, Negation Voice offers a methodologically rigorous, mechanism-driven alternative that can evolve into a sustainable, fee-based model over time.

**Long-Term Expectations:**
1. **More Accurate Reflection of Preferences:** Decisions will better mirror the DAO’s authentic values.  
2. **Reduced Conflicts & Misunderstandings:** Transparent delineation of positive and negative stances fosters clarity and trust.  
3. **Enhanced Agility & Adaptability:** Iterative, data-driven processes allow the DAO to quickly refine its governance frameworks.  
4. **Sustainable Experimentation:** A trajectory for ongoing, scalable deliberation mechanisms emerges, reducing reliance on top-down adjustments.

**How This Differs from Previous Approaches:**
- **Depth of Input:** We don’t rely solely on affirmative votes; we also incorporate structured negations, producing a richer, more nuanced dataset.  
- **Dual-Lens Method:** Using #VOICE to capture what the community wants and The Negation Game to test and filter claims results in a more holistic understanding of collective sentiment than a single mechanism could provide.

## Motivation

**Why Submit This Proposal:**  
The Scroll DAO is at a juncture where it must choose among various governance models. Negation Voice offers a scalable, mechanism-oriented method to navigate complex issues. Rather than a traditional “talk-oriented” approach, this introduces scientifically grounded, experimental protocols that can improve preference discovery and collective decision-making.

The Negation Game is particularly relevant for challenging use cases, such as content moderation, which plagues many digital communities. By applying a falsification-friendly, stake-based bargaining mechanism, The Negation Game helps identify defensible beliefs and discard weaker propositions. Combined with #VOICE’s semantic richness, the DAO gains not just a clearer picture of community desires but also a robust process for filtering out noise and arriving at stable decisions.

**Conflicts of Interest:**  
None anticipated. The proposing team acts in service of strengthening the DAO’s governance capacities, not to privilege any specific faction.

**Why the DAO Should Adopt This Proposal:**  
Adopting Negation Voice positions the Scroll DAO as a leader in governance innovation. Instead of episodic, ad-hoc deliberations, the DAO integrates a sustainable, iterative, and data-driven framework. Over time, these practices can become a core part of how the DAO refines policies, resolves disagreements, and drives continuous improvement in governance outcomes.

## Execution

### Operational

**Tools & Processes:**

- **#VOICE:**
  - Employs Semantic Ballot Voting, where each participant has a voting budget to allocate across semantic tags.
  - Generates a semantic network of preferences, highlighting not only what is valued but how different values interconnect.
  - Natural language data can be interpreted via chatbot interfaces, enhancing understanding of community priorities.

- **The Negation Game:**
  - A structured protocol for testing beliefs by presenting, contesting, and negating claims.
  - Leverages epistemic principles (falsifiability, relevance) and economic theory (bargaining under stakes) to ensure that only well-supported beliefs persist.
  - Helps the DAO approach tough topics (like content moderation) in a rigorous manner, ensuring stable and transparent outcomes.

**Joint Application:**
Running both experiments together provides a feedback loop. #VOICE reveals what the DAO cares about, while The Negation Game rigorously tests and filters these preferences. This combined approach transforms vague sentiments into actionable, evidence-based insights.

**Project Management & Tracking:**
- Documentation on Notion and Google Sheets for transparent planning and outcome tracking.
- Regular online and (where feasible) in-person sessions to pilot the tools.
- Iterative feedback loops for continuous improvement, ensuring lessons learned inform subsequent rounds.

**Scalability & Sustainability:**
Initially, a 2-of-3 multi-sig will manage the treasury. Over time, this structure can evolve into a council and eventually a more decentralized DAO model. Introducing participation fees for events will replenish the treasury, reducing dependency on external funding and ensuring the initiative’s long-term viability.

### Personnel & Resources

**Team Roles & Structure:**
- **Lead Researchers (4 total):**
  - 2 focused on #VOICE (semantic ballot design, preference mapping)
  - 2 focused on The Negation Game (epistemic leverage, falsification frameworks)
  These researchers maintain scientific rigor, guide experimental design, and ensure the integrity of the methodology.

- **Project Managers (2 total):**
  Handle project coherence, scheduling, stakeholder communication, and timely delivery. They ensure alignment with DAO objectives and coordinate across teams.

- **Facilitators (Flexible Pool):**
  A pool of trained facilitators to run #VOICE and Negation Game sessions, help participants understand the tools, and address any user difficulties.

- **Data Analysts (Core + Bounty):**
  A core Data Analyst interprets results and identifies actionable insights. Additional bounties incentivize open-source researchers and data analysts from the community, broadening expertise and perspective.

## Evaluation

**Desired Outcome:**
A robust, continuously improving governance system where both affirmative preferences and tested negations guide decision-making. The DAO gains stable, defensible policies and consensus derived from richer data.

**Early Signs of Failure:**
- Low participant engagement or persistent confusion about The Negation Game’s concepts.
- Data outputs that fail to yield coherent, actionable insights.
- Lack of perceived improvement in governance decisions or community dissatisfaction.

We will monitor these signals within the first quarter. If detected, we will pause, reassess, and refine the methodology or facilitation approach.

**Who Evaluates:**
The Project Managers and Data Analyst, alongside community-appointed reviewers, will evaluate participation metrics, data clarity, and overall sentiment. A transparent evaluation process ensures accountability and fairness.

**Metrics for Success:**
- **Participation:** Strong or growing turnout at events, ongoing engagement with the tools.
- **Data Quality:** Insights that inform future proposals, reduce contention, and clarify community stances.
- **Community Feedback:** Positive perceptions of fairness, relevance, and usefulness of the governance process.
